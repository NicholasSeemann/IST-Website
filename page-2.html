    <h1>
        Imminent Disappointment
    </h1>
    <p>
        While I very much wish that I could give some sort of demonstration on 
        different techniques or even just swing a sword around
        in front of my phone camera, I am unfortunately financially lacking at the moment.
        Instead, here is a video that I will display here in order to prove that I at least know the 
        basics of making a website and how to use HTML and CSS.
        Speaking of which, you may be wondering why this looks poorly made.
        The answer is that I made this site by hand rather than using a tool like
        Wordpress or Wix. It does seem I'm a little rusty, and I'll have to 
        begin practicing web development again.
