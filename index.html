        HEMA, or Historical European Martial Arts,
        are a modern attempt to bring back the martial arts
        techniques of European History through different methods
        such as analyzing texts that date as far back to the 
        Roman Empire, to looking at old paintings depicting
        people fighting each other and attempting to link it 
        to known fighting techniques. Another interesting fact
        is that European 'masters' of various martial arts were known
        to leave behind manuals that are coded in poetry, and so a good deal of effort
        is put into reading these poems and attempting to learn
        the actual techniques hidden within. This could range from 
        hand-to-hand combat, the use of weapons, or grappling
        techniques. The most popular aspect which is focused on,
        however, is sword fighting.
